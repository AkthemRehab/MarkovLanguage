Project Description:



A simple statistical model of language is 
that words follow a Markov chain, with the next word being independent 
of earlier words given the latest word. You will write code to fit this model
 to a collection of documents, to simulate new text from it, and to compare 
it to a second-order Markov chain, where the next word is independent of 
earlier words given the latest two words.
